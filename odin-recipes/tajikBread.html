    <h1>Tajik bread</h1>

    <p>Bread in both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan is somewhat sacred.  You would never cut it with a knife, it is always torn.<br>  
    You never set the loaf upside down as it is considered to be bad luck. 
    If you were to drop it on the floor, it would be set up high for beggars and birds.</p>
